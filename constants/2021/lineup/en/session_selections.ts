      "How Rust triages regressions and prevents them from reaching to stable",
    elevatorPitch:
      "This talk describes how Rust contributors triage regressions and prevent them from reaching Stable Rust. Rust‚Äôs release cycle is relatively fast, but how do they prevent regressions? This talk helps you to understand what and how they‚Äôve been working.",

    elevatorPitch:
      "When using Ruby, it is important to manage your Ruby versions for each project, but installing Ruby with rbenv, the most popular Ruby version manager, takes about two to three minutes. To speed up Ruby installation and simplify Ruby version management, I created a Pure Rust Ruby version manager called frum. This talk will explain what I learned from implementing frum.",

    elevatorPitch:
      "In this presentation, I'll explain the possibility of developing a container runtime in Rust. Based on my experience with youki, the container runtime in Rust that I'm mainly a maintainer, I'll give a more concrete explanation. From these experiences, I believe that Rust is a language that should contribute more to this field. I hope that by sharing my findings in this presentation, many Rustaceans will become interested in this field. At the beginning of the display, I'll also briefly explain container runtime technologies such as cgroups with youki's actual Rust code. If you have touched containers before, you should be able to understand the talk to some extent.",

The goal of the sysinfo crate is to allow users to get system information. The important point being to have one API for all different systems.",

We will look at the official Node.js C++ embedder API and what we can do with Rust‚Äôs FFI despite its lack of C++ support. Much of this is the result of the embedding experiments I did while helping build Orogene - a package manager for Node.js-compatible projects that is written in Rust.",
